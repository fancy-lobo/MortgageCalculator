# To the Owners of 15191 62nd Ave N

## From Luke Chen and Emily Lin

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith, from the moment Emily and I were granted this unique opportunity to see your home, we both quickly realized we had experienced our first, true example of what a forever home should feel like. If we'd been bold enough to request a weeklong stay, we might have thought our honeymoon had started three months early.

## Details

As you may have gathered from the way this letter's been formatted, I'm an IT guy with a background in data analysis. As such, after giving your home and this offer the thoughtful, detail-oriented analysis they both deserve, I’m confident this is a strong match for both sides. 

For that reason, I'm grateful for the support Emily and I have received—from our parents, our agent Brian, our lenders, and God, to confidently meet your asking price. Furthermore, out of deference for this property's history and consideration for your wants and needs, I believe I've lined up the best possible avenue for a smooth, hassle-free transition of home stewardship.

## For Your Considerations

In doing our utmost to present a clean and respectful offer, Emily and I humbly ask for your support—not simply as a financial concession, but as a personal blessing in passing the torch to this next generation of caretakers.

For some added context, Emily and I lean toward the concept of "positive" feelings in one's dwellings. That is to say, we firmly believe committing ourselves to a home with a proven track record of original owners who raised a thriving family puts us on the right footing to start our own.
 
 ## Thank You

We appreciate your consideration of our offer. We hope it reflects our deep respect for the life this home has held—and the future we hope to build within it. We would be honored to continue its legacy.

Signed,
Luke and Emily
