### Note:
The inferred elementary tuition is based on the assumption that lower-grade rates are roughly 57% of the highest grade tuition. This multiplier can be adjusted if you have school-specific data. For instance, if a school like Mounds Park Academy charges \$37,300 for its highest grade, you might want to review the published tuition scale for lower grades to get a more accurate average.
